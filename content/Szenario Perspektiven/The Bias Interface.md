title: The Bias Interface
---
# Core Idea

An **interactive behavioral experiment disguised as a real website** a fake **scholarship or voting platform** where subtle UI changes (button size, color, placement, or wording) **influence how people make decisions**.

The project explores **how interface design can nudge user behavior**, revealing unconscious biases and the ethical implications of persuasive design.

Participants interact with what seems to be a normal decision-making interface — but behind the scenes, every click, hesitation, and choice is part of a **live data visualization of cognitive bias**.

## 1. **Nudging Through Interface Design**

Small, invisible cues influence how users decide:

> e.g.
> “Apply Now” button in bright green vs. dull gray.
> “Agree” button positioned closer than “Disagree.”
> Emotional wording (“You deserve this!” vs. “Submit your data.”).

By systematically altering these variables, the system can measure how design elements affect **trust**, **motivation**, and **compliance**.

The goal: **make users aware** of how easy it is to manipulate digital behavior.


## 2. **Behavioral Data Tracking**

Every interaction button hover, scroll depth, response time is logged and analyzed to reveal subtle behavioral patterns.

The project visualizes this in real time as a **bias map**, showing how different UI layouts shape user choices.

> Example insights:
>
> - 70% more “Yes” clicks when the button is green.
> - Emotional copy leads to longer reading times.
> - Users trust centered layouts over asymmetric ones.

This turns UX testing into an **interactive data art piece** about human psychology.

## 3. **Visualization Layer**

After each participant finishes the “test,” they see a visualization of **how they were nudged** a reflective moment showing which design tricks influenced them most.

At the same time, the public display (projector or dashboard) shows **aggregate data**: how groups react differently under changing conditions.

> e.g.
> A glowing flow chart that shifts color depending on which version (“A” or “B”) is dominating the experiment.


## 4. **Ethical & Artistic Concept**

“The Bias Interface” serves as a **critique of persuasive technology** highlighting the thin line between user guidance and manipulation.

It transforms invisible UX design psychology into an **aesthetic, participatory experience**, merging **research, ethics, and interactive art**.

Visitors walk away asking:

> *Am I making my own choices or just clicking what feels easiest?*


## 5. **Technical Realization Sketch**

- **Frontend:** React or Svelte for dynamic UI generation
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express for A/B randomization logic
- **Analytics:** Firebase / Supabase to store and compare user behavior
- **Visualization:** D3.js or Three.js for bias heatmaps & live charts
- **Optional Sensor Input:** webcam-based gaze tracking (MediaPipe) for eye movement analysis

## Summary

Your **“Bias Interface”** project is:

* **Psychologically deep**
* **Technically feasible**
* **Socially and ethically provocative**
* **Perfectly suited for interactive exhibitions or academic showcases**

It combines **data-driven web design, real-time analytics, and visual storytelling** to make users *feel* how design manipulates them turning UI/UX into a medium of behavioral awareness.
