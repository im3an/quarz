title: Collaborative digital Mosaic
---

## Concept Summary

> “A collaborative digital artwork where every user-uploaded image becomes a tile in an evolving mosaic.\
> Each tile’s position is determined by its dominant color, contributing to a larger master image.\
> When zooming in or hovering, the color tiles reveal the original uploaded photos.”


## Core Features Overview

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| 🖼️ **Image Upload System** | Users can upload images (via drag & drop or file picker). |
| 🎨 **Color Analysis** | Each image is processed to extract the **dominant color** (using k-means clustering or `color-thief`). |
| 🧱 **Mosaic Generator** | Each image is placed in a grid cell where the color best fits the target mosaic. |
| 🔍 **Zoom & Hover Reveal** | When zoomed or hovered, the actual uploaded image appears instead of its color overlay. |
| 🌐 **Dynamic Evolution** | As more images are uploaded, the mosaic continually updates (re-renders or fills more cells). |
| 🖼️ **Multiple Artworks** | Each mosaic can represent a specific target image (e.g., a famous painting, logo, or photo). |
| 💾 **Database + Storage** | Stores image metadata, colors, and user info (e.g., Firebase, Supabase, or AWS S3). |

## Tech Stack Recommendation

| Layer | Recommended Tools |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Frontend (UI)** | React + Next.js + TailwindCSS (smooth zoom + animation + real-time updates) |
| **Backend** | Node.js or Python (FastAPI) |
| **Database** | Firebase or Supabase (image metadata, color data, user tracking) |
| **Storage** | Cloudinary / Firebase Storage / AWS S3 |
| **Color Analysis** | `color-thief`, `vibrant.js`, or Python’s `colorthief` / `PIL` |
| **Mosaic Engine** | Custom algorithm or library like `sharp` / `canvas` for compositing |
| **Realtime Updates** | WebSockets or Firebase Realtime Database for live updates |

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### **Step 1: Frontend Setup**
- Create a Next.js app.
- Add a file uploader (e.g., using `react-dropzone` or MUI’s `Upload` component).
- Implement a live preview after upload.

### **Step 2: Image Upload Handling**
- On upload:
  - Send the image to backend storage (S3/Firebase/Cloudinary).
  - Extract the **dominant color** using `color-thief` (client-side or backend).
  - Save metadata: `{ id, url, color, timestamp, user }` to database.

### **Step 3: Mosaic Algorithm**
- Define a target image or pattern (optional, e.g., Mona Lisa).
- Divide it into small tiles (grid).
- For each uploaded image:
  - Find the tile whose average color most closely matches the uploaded image’s color.
  - Assign that position to the image.
- Store tile position in DB.

### **Step 4: Rendering the Mosaic**
- Use an HTML `<canvas>` or WebGL (e.g., Pixi.js / Three.js) to draw tiles.
- Default: show each tile as a **flat color square**.
- On hover/zoom: fade from color → original image.

### **Step 5: Zoom & Hover Interactions**
- Use libraries like:
  - `react-zoom-pan-pinch` or `react-map-gl` for zooming/panning.
  - On hover: swap color overlay with the original image (smooth fade animation).

### **Step 6: Realtime Mosaic Updates**
- When a new image is uploaded, broadcast changes:
  - Use WebSockets or Firebase Realtime Database.
  - Re-render only affected tiles.

### **Step 7: Artwork System**
- Each artwork = one target mosaic.
- Users can choose or create an artwork (“project”).
- Each project has its own color map and grid layout.

## Data Model Example

### **Image**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "url": "https://storage/.../image.jpg",
  "dominantColor": "#a45f32",
  "position": { "x": 45, "y": 23 },
  "artworkId": "mona-lisa",
  "uploadedBy": "user123",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-10T18:30Z"
}
```

### **Artwork**
```json
{
  "id": "mona-lisa",
  "name": "Mona Lisa Mosaic",
  "gridWidth": 100,
  "gridHeight": 100,
  "targetImageUrl": "https://.../mona-lisa.jpg"
}
```

## Visual Experience (UX ideas)
- **Zoom out:** see the full mosaic, each image as a color pixel.
- **Zoom in / hover:** reveal real uploaded photos.
- **Upload animation:** as users upload, a new tile animates into place.
- **Color fade:** transitions between dominant color and actual image.
- **Leaderboard / Credits:** list top contributors.

## Bonus Extensions
- **AI Enhancement:** Use CLIP or Stable Diffusion to auto-generate artworks from uploaded images.
- **Social Element:** Allow users to “claim” a tile (their photo permanently visible).
- **NFT Integration (optional):** Each uploaded image could represent a tokenized piece of the artwork.
- **Community Challenges:** “Help complete this artwork by uploading red-toned images!”
