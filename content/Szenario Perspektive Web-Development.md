# Scenario Perspectives

## Our Approach

Rather than limiting ourselves to one of the [predefined scenarios](https://cnoss.github.io/entwicklungsprojekt/szenario-ep-2025/), we've decided to take an independent path. We believe that innovation often emerges when you leave established paths and adopt new perspectives.

While the predefined scenario undoubtedly offers a valuable framework, for our specific usage problem and vision, it seemed more sensible to develop a tailored scenario perspective. This allows us to respond more authentically to the actual needs of our stakeholders and create a prototype that doesn't have to be forced into predetermined patterns.

## Our Scenario Ideas

Below we present various scenario perspectives we're considering for our project. Each scenario is evaluated based on its feasibility, relevance, and potential impact.

### Scenario 1: [[./Szenario Perspektiven/Emotional wall.md | Emotional Wall]]

**Problem Statement:**
People often struggle to express or share their emotions â€“ especially in public spaces. There's a lack of creative, anonymous ways to make feelings visible and experience them collectively.

**Target Audience:**
Event attendees, festival guests, museum or gallery visitors â€“ anyone who wants to share emotions spontaneously and anonymously.

**Solution Approach:**
An interactive wall where visitors can input or speak their feelings. The system transforms these emotions into abstract, animated visuals and matching sounds that are projected on a large scale. This creates a vivid mood picture of all those present.

**Technical Challenges:**

- Emotion recognition from text or voice (ML / Sentiment Analysis)
- Real-time visualization (Canvas / WebGL / SVG Animation)
- Scalable projection & browser performance

**Evaluation Criteria from Professional Perspective:**

- **Interaction Design:** intuitive, low-threshold usage
- **Technical Implementation:** stable real-time processing
- **Aesthetics & Expression:** convincing emotional translation

### Scenario 2: [[./Szenario Perspektiven/Interactive Study Chooser.md| Interactive Study Chooser]]

**Problem Statement:**
Prospective students often struggle to find the right degree program â€“ information pages are dry and impersonal.

**Target Audience:**
High school students, prospective students, trade fair visitors.

**Solution Approach:**
An interactive screen with camera and AR elements: users answer brief questions while the system responds with visual filters, facial feedback, and playful animations. At the end, a suitable degree program is suggested â€“ emotionally, immersively, and entertainingly.

**Technical Challenges:**

- Facial recognition & emotion tracking (e.g., TensorFlow.js)
- Real-time AR filters and animations
- Personalized recommendations based on responses

**Evaluation Criteria from Professional Perspective:**

- **Usability:** intuitive and motivating
- **Technology:** stable real-time processing
- **Creativity:** connection of consultation and AR experience

### Scenario 3: [[./Szenario Perspektiven/Whos Watching.md| Whoâ€™s Watching? - Privacy & Behavioral Change ]]

**Problem Statement:**
People behave differently online depending on whether they feel observed. How does perceived surveillance influence honesty and expressive behavior?

**Target Audience:**
Students, online communities, privacy advocates.

**Solution Approach:**
A web portal for anonymous posts (e.g., student confessions or tips). Users receive random hints about their post's visibility ("visible to 50 people") â€” in reality, everything remains anonymous. The system analyzes how perceived publicity affects writing style and openness.

**Technical Challenges:**

- Building an anonymous posting system with data analysis
- Text analysis (tone, length, emotion)
- Privacy & ethical data collection

**Evaluation Criteria from Professional Perspective:**

- **Interactivity:** low-threshold, emotional
- **Technology:** solid backend architecture, sentiment analysis
- **Creativity:** social-psychological experiment as web art

### Scenario 4: [[./Szenario Perspektiven/The Bias Interface.md | The Bias Interface]]

**Problem Statement:**
Users often make decisions unconsciously influenced by design elements. How strongly do colors, layouts, or word choices manipulate our online decisions?

**Target Audience:**
Students, UX/UI designers, researchers in cognitive and behavioral psychology.

**Solution Approach:**
A simulated platform (e.g., for scholarships or voting), where small UI variations (button colors, size, position) are tested. The system measures how design decisions influence user behavior.

**Technical Challenges:**

- A/B testing system for UI variants
- Data collection and evaluation of user decisions
- Visualization of bias results

**Evaluation Criteria from Professional Perspective:**

- **Interactivity:** directly experienceable effect of design decisions
- **Technology:** precise tracking and analysis tools
- **Creativity:** reflects ethical questions in UX design

### Scenario 5: [[./Szenario Perspektiven/Mosaic Generator.md | Mosaic Generator]]

**Problem Statement:**
Collective digital art is usually static or created by individual artists. How can technology enable many users to simultaneously participate in a constantly evolving, aesthetically harmonious artwork?

**Target Audience:**
Artists, digital designers, developers, community platforms, and interactive media projects.

**Solution Approach:**
A collaborative digital platform where each user-uploaded image becomes a "pixel" in a constantly growing mosaic. Each image's position is calculated based on its dominant color and automatically integrated into a larger target graphic (e.g., a painting or logo). When hovering or zooming, the original photos become visible, revealing the diversity of contributions.

**Technical Challenges:**

- Image analysis for dominant color extraction (e.g., via *color-thief* or *k-means clustering*)
- Real-time rendering and dynamic mosaic updates with new uploads
- Performant storage and management of large image volumes (Cloudinary, Firebase, AWS S3)
- Implementation of smooth zoom and hover effects (Canvas, WebGL, or Pixi.js)
- Color-matching algorithm for optimal image placement within the target motif

**Evaluation Criteria from Professional Perspective:**

- **Interactivity:** collective, permanently changing artwork
- **Technology:** seamless integration of frontend, backend, and color analysis
- **Creativity:** aesthetic interplay of algorithms, design, and community
